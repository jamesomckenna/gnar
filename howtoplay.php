        <p><ol>
          <li class="li-htp">No Cheating is allowed and if found will be harshly punished!</li>
          <li class="li-htp">Players are responsible for keeping their own score</li>
          <li class="li-htp">Dont have fun this is a serious event for serious people. We play for seriious cash prizes</li>
          <li class="li-htp">The player with the highest “GNAR factor” (see scoring) wins!<br><br></li>
        </ol></p>
      <h2 class="htp-h2">How to get points</h2>
        <p>There are 3 ways you can get points and many ways to loose them. All listed below!!!</p>
      <h3>Runs</h3>
        <p>Whether it's Mousetrap or Widowmaker, open or closed every run you do will earn you points! 
        (mostly, some access trails have been excluded) 
        Unlike regular GNAR where only double black dimonds can earn you points 
        every top to bottom run you complete will give ya some. 
        The trick is only the highest scoring run will score you points each lap. </p><ul>
          <li class="li-htp">Example 1.<br>You're headding down drovers but you decide to take a dip through the trees over to Highway 83. 
          Technically youve done top of Wombats Ramble, Drovers Dream and Highway 83. Only Highway 83 would score points! </li><br> 
          <li class="li-htp">Example 2. <br>You're bombing it down last hoot and dont want to stack it on the mogul's at the bottom so you duck onto Wombats Ramble.
          Even though you've done both Wombats Ramble and Last Hoot only last hoot would score points!!</li></ul>
        <p>Please check the full list of runs that can score you points: <a class="htp-a" href="pointslist.php">here</a></p><br><br>

      <h3>Tricks</h3>
        <p>Tricks are a great way to earn those precious points while making you look steezy at the same time. 
        You can preform as many tricks each lap as you want but be carefull any stack/crash will cost you dearly!
        <br> Tricks are split up into:
        <ul>
          <li class="li-htp">Air</li>
          <li class="li-htp">Grabs</li>
          <li class="li-htp">Flat/knuckle</li>
          <li class="li-htp">Rail/Boxes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tricks are counted in the park or when you do a run. 
        However Tricks preformed repeatedly on flatground do not count because ollie-ing on the spot is too easy.
        Harder the trick the larger the reward. Get shredding!!!!
        <br>A full list of scoring tricks is available <a class="htp-a" href="pointslist.php/#Runs">here</a></p>
    
      <h3>ECP's (extra curricular points)</h3>
        <p>
          Of all the methods ECPS provide the MOST points!!! 
          Some ECPS such as First Chair, Saftey Test and The TJ can only be done once a day. 
          Others such as Happy Chair, Pro Callout and The Rizzler can be attempted as many times as you can!! 
          <br>The list of ECP's can be found <a class="htp-a" href="pointslist.php">here</a>
          Read the challages and scheme cunningly!!
          <br>Please see bigbird for any clarification regarding ECP's
        </p>
      <h3>Deductions</h3>
        <p>Finally the dreadful component of Deductions. No one likes having a stack. 
          So don't. Crashing and Stacking whilst funny to watch serverely hurts your gnar factor. 
          To add isult to injury(litterally) day ending injurys will hurt twice as much (flip does not cover GNAR points).
          Other deductions can be caused by being a dick and cutting lift line, getting your lift pass pulled, annoying the committee/trip leaders 
          and looking too much like a jerry.
        <br>For a complete list of Deductions check <a class="htp-a" href="pointslist.php">here</a> </p>
